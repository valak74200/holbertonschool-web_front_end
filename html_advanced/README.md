![Techium Logo](favicon.png)

## Project Overview

This directory contains the HTML structure for the Techium website, a fictional digital agency. The project focuses on creating semantically valid HTML without any CSS or styling. This forms the foundation for the CSS styling that will be applied in the CSS_advanced section of the project.

## Project Structure

The files in this directory are organized as follows:

- **Numbered files (0-index.html to 39-styleguide.html)**: Progressive development of the website, each file building on concepts from previous ones
- **Final website files**:
  - `index.html`: Main homepage
  - `about.html`: About page with company information
  - `latest_news.html`: News and updates page
  - `contact.html`: Contact information page
  - `styleguide.html`: Reference for HTML elements used throughout the site

## Key Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Proper use of HTML tags for content organization
- Accessible markup
- Logical document structure
- Implementation of various HTML elements:
  - Headings and paragraphs
  - Lists (ordered, unordered, definition)
  - Links and buttons
  - Images and multimedia
  - Forms and input elements
  - Tables
  - Quotes and citations
  - Semantic sectioning elements
  - Metadata and document structure

## Learning Objectives

By working through these files, you will learn:

- How to create a structured HTML document
- Proper use of semantic tags
- How to organize content in a logical way
- Best practices for web accessibility
- How to prepare HTML for future styling with CSS
- How to create forms and handle user input
- How to implement navigation structures
- How to use HTML to create a complete website structure
- How to use HTML5 features effectively

## How to Use

Each numbered file represents a step in the development process. To understand the progression:

1. Start with `0-index.html` and work your way through the numbered files
2. Compare changes between consecutive files to see what was added or modified
3. Use `styleguide.html` as a reference for HTML elements and their proper usage

## Key Concepts Covered

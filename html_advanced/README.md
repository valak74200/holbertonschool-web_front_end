## Project Overview

This directory contains the HTML structure for the Techium website, a fictional digital agency. The project focuses on creating semantically valid HTML without any CSS or styling.

## Project Structure

The files in this directory are organized as follows:

- **Numbered files (0-index.html to 39-styleguide.html)**: Progressive development of the website, each file building on concepts from previous ones
- **Final website files**:
  - `index.html`: Main homepage
  - `about.html`: About page with company information
  - `latest_news.html`: News and updates page
  - `contact.html`: Contact information page
  - `styleguide.html`: Reference for HTML elements used throughout the site

## Key Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Proper use of HTML tags for content organization
- Accessible markup
- Logical document structure
- Implementation of various HTML elements:
  - Headings and paragraphs
  - Lists (ordered, unordered, definition)
  - Links and buttons
  - Images and multimedia
  - Forms and input elements
  - Tables
  - And more!

## Learning Objectives

By working through these files, you will learn:

- How to create a structured HTML document
- Proper use of semantic tags
- How to organize content in a logical way
- Best practices for web accessibility
- How to prepare HTML for future styling with CSS

## How to Use

Each numbered file represents a step in the development process. To understand the progression:

1. Start with `0-index.html` and work your way through the numbered files
2. Compare changes between consecutive files to see what was added or modified
3. Use `styleguide.html` as a reference for HTML elements and their proper usage
